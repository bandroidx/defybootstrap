This is the source code for defy's bootstrap recovery. I have release all the source i use and modified.
and this is  a kind a mess.
I didn't keep the original one.
This is the latest version I try to build for defy.

Use at your own risk.

you can use this cold to setup a umts_jordan vendor
build a recovery binary
build the hijack binary
build the System Recovery apk file
and you can modify it at your own need
you can email me if you have any questions.

Thank you
